            <p class="justice">You might have saw me on Facebook, Instagram or YouTube reviewing books and share the
                learnings from
                those books. However, I am mainly working at Nokia as a Software Engineer and Web Developer. I also
                teach web developmnet on YouTube completely free of cost. Moreover, if you want to make a website for
                your organisation or for personal use you can see me on Linked-in</p>

            <h3>Become A Reader</h3>
            <p class="justice">You must read book. You can gather a person's many years of research result and
                experience in one book.
                Just imagine, by only reading a book how you can intake all those knowledge. Moreover, reading improves
                the way we think. Whenever we are reading a stroy, we picture that scenerio in our mind. This enhance
                our ability to think more critically and systematically.</p>
